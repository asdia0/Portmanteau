# Portmanteau
Finding the [shortest superstring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_common_supersequence_problem) of [all the words in the English language](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt). Inspired by @Tom7 [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVn2PZGZxaI).

The generated superstring can be found [here](resources/portmanteau.txt). Note that some manual work is needed to generate the full portmanteau due to .NET's limit on string size.
